# Test Data Generator Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the test data generator tool that will create realistic event data for the FoodTrack analytics system, as specified in the test-data.md specification.

## 2. Architecture

The test data generator will be implemented as a standalone Java application with the following architecture:

```
com.foodtracker.generator
├── TestDataManager.java          # Main orchestrator class
├── UserGenerator.java            # User ID generation
├── SessionGenerator.java         # Session ID generation
├── EventGenerator.java           # Event creation logic
├── JourneyBuilder.java           # User journey construction
├── ApiServiceClient.java         # API integration
├── AnalyticsValidator.java       # Analytics query validation
└── config/
    └── GeneratorConfig.java      # Configuration settings
```

## 3. Component Design

### 3.1 UserGenerator
- Generate unique user IDs in the format `user_<number>`
- Support configurable user count (default: 50-100 users)
- Ensure uniqueness across all generated IDs

### 3.2 SessionGenerator
- Generate unique session IDs in the format `sess_<alphanumeric>`
- Create 1-5 sessions per user
- Support session duration simulation

### 3.3 EventGenerator
- Create events following the required schema
- Generate proper timestamps with realistic intervals
- Support all event types (app_opened, screen_viewed, item_viewed, etc.)
- Include appropriate properties for each event type

### 3.4 JourneyBuilder
- Create realistic user journeys through the conversion funnel
- Support different journey types (complete, partial, error scenarios)
- Implement logical event sequencing with proper timestamps
- Include category-specific journeys for pizza and burger

### 3.5 ApiServiceClient
- Integrate with the existing `/api/track` endpoint
- Handle HTTP requests and response validation
- Include error handling for failed submissions
- Support batch event submission for efficiency

### 3.6 AnalyticsValidator
- Validate that generated data supports DAU calculations
- Test conversion funnel queries for pizza and burger categories
- Verify popular items identification
- Calculate expected vs. actual analytics results

## 4. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Generation Components
- Implement UserGenerator
- Implement SessionGenerator
- Implement basic EventGenerator
- Implement simple event structure creation

### Phase 2: Journey Construction
- Build JourneyBuilder with funnel capabilities
- Implement complete funnels for pizza and burger
- Add partial funnel support
- Include proper timestamp sequencing

### Phase 3: API Integration
- Develop ApiServiceClient
- Implement event submission to `/api/track`
- Add response validation
- Include error handling

### Phase 4: Analytics Validation
- Build AnalyticsValidator
- Implement DAU validation tests
- Create conversion funnel validation
- Add popular items validation

### Phase 5: Configuration and Testing
- Add configuration options
- Create main execution class
- Test end-to-end functionality
- Document usage instructions

## 5. Data Generation Strategy

### 5.1 User Distribution
- Generate 75 total users by default
- 40 users for pizza category
- 35 users for burger category
- Allow configuration override

### 5.2 Session Distribution
- Each user gets 1-5 sessions (randomly distributed)
- Sessions spread across multiple days
- Realistic session timeframes

### 5.3 Event Sequencing
- App open → screen view → item view → add to cart → checkout start → order placement
- Include realistic time intervals between events
- Support multiple items per session
- Implement error scenarios (payment failures)

## 6. API Integration Details

### 6.1 Event Submission
- Send events to `POST /api/track`
- Validate 200 OK response for successful submissions
- Log failed submissions with error details
- Support retry logic for failed requests

### 6.2 Error Handling
- Catch and log API connection errors
- Handle validation errors from the API
- Continue generation despite individual failures
- Provide summary of successful vs. failed submissions

## 7. Validation Criteria

### 7.1 Data Quality
- All events follow the required schema
- Properly formatted timestamps
- Valid user and session IDs
- Consistent event sequencing

### 7.2 Analytics Support
- Generated data produces meaningful DAU values
- Conversion funnels show realistic rates
- Popular items can be identified from the data
- Error scenarios are properly represented

## 8. Configuration Options

The generator should support the following configuration options:
- Number of users to generate
- Date range for events
- Probability of different event types
- Batch size for API submissions
- Verbose logging option

## 9. Testing Approach

- Unit tests for each generator component
- Integration tests with the event tracking API
- Validation tests for analytics queries
- Performance tests with larger data sets
